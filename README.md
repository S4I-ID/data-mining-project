## Running the application

1. Clone the project in a directory of your choice.
2. Use an IDE to build and run the Java code. We have used IntelliJ IDEA IDE to build the project and run it.
3. Open the directory in which you have cloned the source code as a project in IntelliJ.
4. Use the Maven build tool to compile the code and get the required dependencies.
5. Run the IndexBuilder class to build the index.
6. After the index is built, run the App class. The application's output will be in the console. To switch between normal document retrieval and ChatGPT enhanced retrieval, you can change the boolean value at the top of the App class.
